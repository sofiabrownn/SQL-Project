# SQL-Project- Analyzing the value of playlisting using Spotify data
## Project Objective
<p>The aim of this project is to transform a job posting into a valuable project that effectively showcases my capabilities to the hiring manager, positioning me as a strong candidate for the Universal Music Group 2023 Summer Internship position. The job posting says that the intern will work on a project that contrasts the effect of a song getting on a large playlist as opposed to the value of getting on smaller playlists. My project uses the Spotify API to extract relevant playlists that will help me address the value of songs on different playlists. I then input all the data I collected into an AWS RDS and used SQL to run insightful queries on the data I collected. </p>

## Job Description 
<p> The internship position is with Universal Music Group (UMG). UMG is one of the world’s largest music companies. The company is responsible for discovering and signing artists in the music industry. This company has signed artists like Taylor Swift, Drake, Elton John, and many more. The position provides the intern with opportunities in analytics specifically SQL and Python. Furthermore the position hopes interns have API experience. This position is directly tied into the project since all the skills the job requires are the skills I must use to complete the project. As a Business Analytics major, taking a class called Developing Business Apps Using SQL, I have not just learned how to use web API's to extract relevant data, but also how to analyze that data to create meaningful insights. The basis of UMG’s intern’s project directly aligns with the project I need to complete for class. </p>

## Data
<p> All the data I am working with is retrieved from Spotify's web API. Each one of the tables in my database is its own playlist and contains data on individual songs within the playlist such as song id, artist name, the release date of the song, and song popularity. </p>

## Future Improvements
<p> My first improvement would be to include a wider variety of playlists to make my findings more valuable. To implement this change I would change my python code and make it more efficient so that it would be able to loop through playlists faster. The second improvement would be to collect information from other music charts like Tik Tok or Apple Music. This way I could see if there are any differences across platforms, and I could generate more meaningful insights. I would also conduct more research on the specific artists that are signed to UMG and track their success across playlists instead of focusing on general playlists and songs. </p>
